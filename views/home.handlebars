      <p><b>DÜDL</b> is a multiplayer drawing and guessing game. One game consists of 
      rounds where players take turns drawing a word while the other players try and guess 
      it to gain points. At the end of each round, the player with the most points wins!! </p>
      <br>
      <h3>How to Play</h3>
      <p>If it's your turn as the DÜDLER, you will choose a word and then have 90 seconds
      to draw that word. Or, if you're guessing, type your guess in the chat to gain points.
      Oh and think fast, because the quicker you answer the more points you will get!!</p>
